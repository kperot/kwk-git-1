    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="aboutme">
        <p>Hey there! My name is Kristen Perot and I am a computer science student from Atlanta, Georgia! I'm really passionate the intersection of helping people and technology, so that's what I hope to pursue out of college. In my free time, I love to read, play video games, and spend time with my friends and family. I also enjoy hiking and exploring new places. I'm always looking for new adventures and experiences! </p>

    <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
    <div class="coding">
        <img src="de740dabeaf8ffcea12ac2a1648c6bd7.jpg">
        <p>My first coding exposure began in elementary school. Early on I fell in love with "An Hour of Code" from Code.org, and I kept with it through middle school.
            In middle school, I participated in afterschool groups taught by older girls and competed in local competitions. Because of these educational opportunities, I decided that this is what I truly wanted to do.
            While in high school, I took AP Computer Science Classes and participated in summer immersions through Kode With Klossy and Girls Who Code. These experiences shape who I am today and remind me of how important it is to advocate for women and girls in tech!
            Now, I am a sophomore at Georgia State University, and I take pride in being able to share my knowledge with others and learn more about the field I love.
